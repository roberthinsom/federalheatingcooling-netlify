            <ol>
                <li><strong>Schedule Regular Inspections:</strong> Routine inspections by certified HVAC technicians are essential. Federal Heating & Cooling recommends scheduling inspections at least once a year to check for leaks, clean components, and ensure proper airflow.</li>
